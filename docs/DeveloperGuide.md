# Developer Guide

## 1. Introduction
Cent Wise Dollar Wise is a desktop application for money management, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI). This application aims to help NUS hostel students manage their financial situation and track their spending efficiently. 
This developer guide provides information on the architecture and design of the application. It will not only help you get started as a Cent Wise Dollar Wise contributer, but that you will find useful to refer to even if you are already a contributer of this project. 

## 2. Setting up
### 2.1 Prerequisites
- JDK 11 <br>
- IntelliJ IDE <br>
🛈 IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. <br>
🛈 Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to File > Settings > Plugins to re-enable them.

### 2.2 Setting up the project in your computer
The following are the steps to set up the project in your computer:
1. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer.
2. Open IntelliJ. If you are not in the welcome screen, click File > Close Project to close the existing project dialog first.
3. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45732128/97735431-4886f780-1b15-11eb-920c-24e5bf7a76fe.png) <br>

The architecture diagram above explains the high-level design of the application. Given below is a quick overview of each component:

Main: Initializes spending list at app launch and coordinates the interaction between other components

DukeException: Issues exceptions if there are errors in storage or wrong format of user input is detected

SpendingList: Stores the expenditure of the user as individual entries

Storage: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk

Ui: Interacts with the user

Command: Executes the user command or system-issued command

Parser: Analyzes the user command


**How the architecture components interact with each other** <br>

The sequence diagram below shows how the components interact with each other when the user issues a general command. <br>

### 3.2 UI component

### 3.3 Parser component

### 3.4 Command component
Every command that a user can input into the application is represented by an object that extends the abstract class `Command`. In addition, hidden commands that do not require user inputs also extends from the same abstract class `Command`. `Command` contains some basic methods that are shared by all types of commands, including:
* execute(), which is called after setting up the object appropriately, to perform the action requested by the user; and
* isExit(), which returns a boolean that indicates whether the program should terminate after the command is executed.

The following sections classify the `Command`s into different types based on their functionality within the application.

#### 3.4.1 CLI `Command`s related to Spending List
The following class diagram describes the CLI `Command`s specifically related to the spending list.

### 3.5 Data component
This component holds the data of the application, including the SpendingList class, Budget class and RepaymentList 
class, in the memory.

#### 3.5.1 SpendingList
The SpendingList class also stores a list of Item objects that the user has spent. The `SpendingList` does not depend on 
Ui, Parser and Storage components. 

Below shows a class diagram how `SpendingList` interacts with other classes.

## 4. Implementation
### 4.1 Add Feature
`SpendingList`, `SpendingListCategoriser` and `Ui` facilitate this feature. The Add feature is able to add a new item into the spending list. It implements the following operations:
* `AddCommand#updateAmount` → converts amount to SGD
* `AddCommand#updateCurrency` → updates currency to SGD
* `SpendingList#addItem` → adds item into the spending list
* `Ui#printAdd` → prints the message that the item is successfully added into the spending list
* `SpendingListCategoriser#execute`→ categorises the item in the spending list
* `WarnCommand#execute` → prints warning message if total spending amount approaches the threshold of 90% of the budget limit or when the total spending amount exceeds the budget limit

Below shows an example of usage:
1. User types `add -c food -d beer -s USD 10` to add chicken rice into the spending list
2. The `add` command calls `AddCommand#execute`
3. `AddCommand#execute` calls the following operations in order:
   1. AddCommand#updateAmount to convert the amount “10” to SGD
   2. AddCommand#updateCurrency to update the currency from “USD” to “SGD”
   3. SpendingList#addItem to add beer into the spending list
   4. Ui#printAdd to print a message if beer is successfully added into the spending list
   5. SpendingListCategoriser#execute to categorise beer under the food category of the spending list
   6. WarnCommand#execute to print a warning message if required
   
The following sequence diagram illustrates how this feature works.

* `Budget#clearBudget` → clears budget
* `RepaymentList#deleteRepaymentEntry` → deletes a particular entry of the repayment list
* `RepaymentList#clearAllEntries` → clears all entries of the repayment list
* `Ui#printClearAllRepaymentList` → prints the message that all entries in the repayment list are cleared
* `SpendingList#deleteItem` → deletes a particular entry of the spending list
* `SpendingList#clearAllItems` → clears all entries of the spending list
* `Ui#printClearAllSpendingList` → prints the message that all entries in the spending list are cleared
* `Ui#printClearIndex` → prints the message that an entry is cleared from either the repayment list or the spending list
* `Ui#printPurgeData` → prints the message that all data is cleared

Below shows an example of usage:
1. User types `clear -s 1` to clear the first entry in the spending list.
2. ClearSpendingListCommand calls `ClearSpendingListCommand#execute`, which calls the following operations in order:
   1. SpendingList#clearAllItems to clear all items in the spending list and saves the updated spending list in storage.
   2. Ui#printClearAllSpendingList to print a message if the spending list is cleared successfully
   
The following sequence diagram illustrates how clearing a spending list works.

is approaching budget limit (i.e. exceeds the threshold value of 90% of the budget limit but not yet exceed it), with 
the amount remaining
* `Ui#printExceedingWarningMessage` → prints the warning message that the spending has exceeded the budget limit

Below shows an example of usage:
1. User adds the spending to the spending list after setting the budget limit
2. The `add` command calls `WarnCommand#execute` to check if the user approaches or exceeds budget 
limit 

The following sequence diagram illustrates how this feature works.
