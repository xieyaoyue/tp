## 1. Introduction
Cent Wise Dollar Wise is a desktop application for money management, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI). This application aims to help NUS hostel students manage their financial situation and track their spending efficiently. 
This developer guide provides information on the architecture and design of the application. It will not only help you get started as a Cent Wise Dollar Wise contributor, but that you will find useful to refer to even if you are already a contributor of this project. 

## 2. Setting Up
### 2.1 Prerequisites
- JDK 11 <br>
- IntelliJ IDE <br>
🛈 IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. <br>
🛈 Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to File > Settings > Plugins to re-enable them.

### 2.2 Setting Up the Project in your Computer
The following are the steps to set up the project in your computer:
1. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer.
2. Open IntelliJ. If you are not in the welcome screen, click File > Close Project to close the existing project dialog first.
3. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle.
4. Click Configure > Project Defaults > Project Structure.
5. Click New…​ and find the directory of the JDK.
6. Click Import Project.
7. Locate the build.gradle file and select it. Click OK
8. Click Open as Project
9. Click OK to accept the default settings
10. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the BUILD SUCCESSFUL message. This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

### 2.3 Verifying the Setup
The following are the steps to verify your setup:
1. Run the seedu.duke.Duke and try a few commands.
2. Run the tests and ensure all the tests pass.

## 3. Design
### 3.1 Architecture
![image](images/architecture.png) <br>

The architecture diagram above explains the high-level design of the application. Given below is a quick overview of each component:

`main`: Initializes spending list at app launch and coordinates the interaction between other components

`data`: Stores the data collected from the user

`storage`: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk

`ui`: Interacts with the user

`command`: Executes the user command or system-issued command

`parser`: Analyzes the user command

`utilities`: Contains classes that are used by multiple components

**How the Architecture Components Interact with Each Other** <br>

The sequence diagram below shows how the components interact with each other when the user issues a general command. <br>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45732128/97735507-62c0d580-1b15-11eb-9f14-aab54bf5b29d.png) <br>


### 3.2 UI Component
This component, consisting of the `Ui` class, is responsible for receiving user input and displaying appropriate output messages for the user. This includes error messages, warning messages, encouragement quotes, and messages that indicate if a command is successfully executed. 

### 3.3 Parser Component

### 3.4 Command Component
Every command that a user can input into the application is represented by an object that extends the abstract class `Command`. In addition, hidden commands that do not require user inputs also extends from the same abstract class `Command`. `Command` contains some basic methods that are shared by all types of commands, including:
* execute(), which is called after setting up the object appropriately, to perform the action requested by the user; and
* isExit(), which returns a boolean that indicates whether the program should terminate after the command is executed.

The following sections classify the `Command`s into different types based on their functionality within the application.

#### 3.4.1 CLI `Command`s related to Spending List
The following class diagram describes the CLI `Command`s specifically related to the spending list. <br>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45732128/97780213-3c0aa980-1bbe-11eb-8ab7-2a553d7b7111.png) <br>

#### 3.4.2 CLI `Command`s related to Repayment List
The following class diagram describes the CLI `Command`s specifically related to the repayment list. <br>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45732128/97780261-7e33eb00-1bbe-11eb-95e7-1418969f3fac.png)

#### 3.4.3 CLI `Command`s related to Budget
The following class diagram describes the CLI `Command`s specifically related to the budget. <br>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45732128/97780278-9c015000-1bbe-11eb-921b-69dfabacadab.png)

#### 3.4.4 General CLI `Command`s 
The following class diagram describes general CLI `Command`s that apply to the whole application. <br>

#### 3.4.5 Hidden `Command`s
The following class diagram describes the hidden commands within the program. <br>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60251547/98458937-9fa16200-21d0-11eb-91fe-968ca030149c.png)


### 3.5 Data Component
This component holds the data of the application, including the SpendingList class and RepaymentList class, 
in the memory.

#### 3.5.1 Spending List
The SpendingList class stores a list of `Item` objects that the user has spent. The `SpendingList` does not depend on 
Ui, Parser and Storage components. 

Below shows a class diagram how `SpendingList` interacts with other classes. <br>

![image](images/spendingListClass.png)

#### 3.5.2 Repayment List
The RepaymentList class stores a list of `Repay` objects. Similar to SpendingList class, RepaymentList class does not 
depend on other components. 

Below shows a class diagram how `RepaymentList` interacts with other classes. <br>

![image](images/repaymentListClass.png)

### 3.6 Storage Component


## 4. Implementation
### 4.1 Add Feature
`SpendingList`, `SpendingListCategoriser` and `Ui` facilitate this feature. The Add feature is able to add a new item into the spending list. It implements the following operations:
* `AddCommand#updateAmount` → converts amount to SGD
* `AddCommand#updateCurrency` → updates currency to SGD
* `SpendingList#addItem` → adds item into the spending list
* `Ui#printAdd` → prints the message that the item is successfully added into the spending list
* `SpendingListCategoriser#execute`→ categorises the item in the spending list
* `WarnCommand#execute` → prints warning message if total spending amount approaches the threshold of 90% of the budget limit or when the total spending amount exceeds the budget limit

Below shows an example of usage:
1. User types `add -c food -d beer -s USD 10` to add chicken rice into the spending list
2. The `add` command calls `AddCommand#execute`
3. `AddCommand#execute` calls the following operations in order:
   1. AddCommand#updateAmount to convert the amount “10” to SGD
   2. AddCommand#updateCurrency to update the currency from “USD” to “SGD”
   3. SpendingList#addItem to add beer into the spending list
   4. Ui#printAdd to print a message if beer is successfully added into the spending list
   5. SpendingListCategoriser#execute to categorise beer under the food category of the spending list
   6. WarnCommand#execute to print a warning message if required
   
The following sequence diagram illustrates how this feature works. <br>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45732128/97770676-60d83000-1b70-11eb-95c1-63c2b300af05.png) <br>

* `RepaymentList#clearAllEntries` → clears all entries of the repayment list
* `Ui#printClearAllRepaymentList` → prints the message that all entries in the repayment list are cleared
* `SpendingList#deleteItem` → deletes a particular entry of the spending list
* `SpendingList#clearAllItems` → clears all entries of the spending list
* `Ui#printClearAllSpendingList` → prints the message that all entries in the spending list are cleared
* `Ui#printClearIndex` → prints the message that an entry is cleared from either the repayment list or the spending list
* `Ui#printPurgeData` → prints the message that all data is cleared

Below shows an example of usage:
1. User types `clear -s 1` to clear the first entry in the spending list.
2. ClearSpendingListCommand calls `ClearSpendingListCommand#execute`, which calls the following operations in order:
   1. SpendingList#clearAllItems to clear all items in the spending list and saves the updated spending list in storage.
   2. Ui#printClearAllSpendingList to print a message if the spending list is cleared successfully
   
The following sequence diagram illustrates how clearing a spending list works. <br>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45732128/97770858-08099700-1b72-11eb-86e4-80e07c416ea6.png) <br>

## 5 Dev Ops
### 5.1 Build Automation
This project uses Gradle for build automation and dependency management. <br>

Given below are how to use Gradle for some important project tasks: <br>

* `clean`: Deletes the files created during the previous build tasks (e.g. files in the build folder). e.g. ./gradlew clean
* `shadowJar`: Uses the ShadowJar plugin to creat a fat JAR file in the build/lib folder, if the current file is outdated. e.g. ./gradlew shadowJar
* `run`: Builds and run the program. 
* `runShadow`: Builds the application as a fat JAR, and then runs it.
* `checkstyleMain`: Runs the code style check for the main code base. 
* `checkstyleTest`: Runs the code style check for the test code base.
* `test`: Runs all tests.
  * `./gradlew test` — Runs all tests
  * `./gradlew clean test` — Cleans the project and runs tests

### 5.2 Continuous Integration (CI)
This project uses GitHub Actions for CI. The project comes with the necessary GitHub Actions configurations files (in the .github/workflows folder). 

### 5.3 Making a release
Here are the steps to create a new release:

1. Generate a fat JAR file using Gradle by using the command `gradlew shadow` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean shadowJar`).
2. Find the JAR file in the `build/libs` directory.
3. Tag the repository with a new version number.
4. [Create a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/). Upload the JAR file you created.

### 5.4 Coverage Reporting
We use the IntelliJ IDEA’s coverage analysis tool for coverage reporting. A video tutorial on how to use this tool can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYzZvyA2ik&feature=youtu.be).
